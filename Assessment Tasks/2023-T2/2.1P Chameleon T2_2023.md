<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open data division has been engaged with Melbourne City to support greater use of their Open Data library by businesses, researchers, and software developers. MOP delivers an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage Open Data using real-world scenarios which helps Melbourne City achieve one of their key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>
The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company overall to present in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and useful components to display the progress of all 3 projects while outlining their goals. Which aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

# <a name="tri-goals"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Trimester Goals & Objectives</h1>

### <a name="objectives"></a>T1-2023 Objectives
Along with moving each of the Chameleon projects forward, closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.

- Document a policy for creating and storing documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. Once created, migrating company documents to GitHub converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future students to take the lead. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students (who are on lead) brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Have multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon app strives to provide owners of Electric Vehicles (EVs) with tools to assist in planning their travels by utilising the user-friendly application and charging station data to determine the most efficient route. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The Evoleon app is an application-based (Android and IOS) solution for finding EV charging stations based on criteria entered by a user. While not unique, the Evoleon app strives to be the best solution on the market by offering features to make it a more rounded product experience; these features include:  
- The use of filtering certain charging stations based on different types of EV fuel sources (Hydrogen and Electricity) and other amenities such as cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers. 
- Utilise a journey planner to create a more effective route for users traveling from point A to B to reduce the time taken and environmental impact to reach their intended destination. 
- Calculating the cost of users driving their EVs compared to traditional combustion cars provides an overview of actual savings running an EV. 
- A clean and intuitive interface can be utalised by any user who downloads the app. 


#### Aims this Trimester
Through the development life cycle of the Evoleon application, a high-fidelity prototype has been produced. Following the recommendations outlined last trimester, the team is looking to finalise the new EVAT colour scheme bringing the application more in-line with other products produced by EVAT. By the end of the trimester, the Evoleon app dev team wants to be able to set forward their vision for the Evoleon application. 

#### Deliverables
- Improve the existing navigation system, allowing the routing to be in the app instead of sending users to Google Maps. 
- Change hardcoded colour values to dynamic variables so the application's color scheme can be changed efficiently and effectively in case of a branding update. 
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in the database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom, similar to the Figma designs.
- Research and conduct a security audit of the application and its backend services to determine if there are any severe risks to users and their data. 
- Continue to expand and improve the application interface, making it more user-friendly.

<a name="playground"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Melbourne Open Data</h2>

#### Overview

The City of Melbourne has been an Australian leader in Open Data since 2014. The City of Melbourne initiated this project with Deakin to support greater use of their Open Data by businesses, researchers, and software developers. Open Data is a component of their smart cities' strategy.

#### Goals & Objectives

This project entails the development of an educational platform that showcases the practical applications of Open Data, specifically designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders, such as industry professionals, government entities, and academic researchers. The primary objective of this project is to leverage the utilisation of the City of Melbourne's Open Data.

The long-term goal is to data useage, facilitating innovative and informed solutions to contemporary challenges across the City of Melbourne council area.

#### Aims this Trimester

The initial main focus is to read the documentation for the new API for the Melbourne Open Data Playground, and systematically work through each published (and yet to be published) notebooks and modify the code so that they will run if downloaded.

The aim for the Data Science team is to create a new set of use cases that fit within the 3 defined key areas of interest from the City Of Melbourne. The team is planning to complete a full set of use cases, and also have enough in the backlog for the next trimester when students will be focussed on InnoFes.

The web team is aiming to further streamline the processes for which the notebooks are published, and working with the design team to optimise the device browsing of our website. As part of the approach to the website, the cyber security team will be conducting tests and an audit, not only the MOP project but also throughout the whole of Chameleon to ensure that no division has dropped the ball when it comes to security, all tests will be reported and if there any major issues detected within any of the projects the leader(s) in charge will know so they can guide their team into ensuring the best practices are being implemented.



#### Deliverables

- Update the API on all published notebooks (ready to be published again), and notebooks ready for publishing.
- Implement a human-readable URL
- Identify vulnerabilities in the source code, python code and database then document a roadmap to mitigatethem
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Complete analysis on multiple use cases (ready for publishing)
- Create multiple new use cases, allowing enough in the backlog for the next trimester
- Publish notebooks that are ready to be published
- Cleaner resources for the handover procedures for MOP
- Add more functionality to the website
- Implement some interactivity with JavaScript
- Fix the lingering deisgn / css issues within the website

## <a name="cham"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Chameleon Website</h2>

#### Overview

The website for the Chameleon company overall aims to publicise the achievements and progress of Chameleon overall and showcase the sub-companies within it, one of the best ways to do this is through a website. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The main objectives of this website is to provide a one-stop for all – where it includes all the other sub-companies’ infortmation, objectives and links. We want to be able to use this website to advocate for the company, and be able to promote it while having the website be visually appealing, and comes with easy functionality.

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website majority, and make it optimised for mobile access. While the backend hasn’t been implemented, it means we have a lot of scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal, implementing API’s with SendGrid and Mailchimp and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing, with the design and web development skills of the students. We want to deliver a high-quality attrractive, easy to navigate and overall simple aesthetic of the website. This also means through using correct wireframing techniques within the design team, agreeing on a solid design that meets this criteria before implementing.

It will be imporant for the Chameleon Website to present all the other projects for the Chameleon company on the website, while this has currently been started – links have not been provided. 

Overall, reducing awkwardness on the website and providing a smooth experience is the overall aim for this trimester. 


#### Deliverables

- Implement a more aesthetic and navigation friendly design
- Work on the blogging section of the website – add links to other projects
- Build the staff portal and implement the API’s behind it to get it running
- Reevaluate the Resources tab to see what can be added and removed from it
- Work on the fonts used and colour scheme of the website, and adding in different components to the website design
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Implement SEO strategy to rank the website higher in web search engines
- Building a client user account portal to view progress, updates and services of the Chameleon Projects
